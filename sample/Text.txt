The world we live in.
It's so wondrous, mysterious,
even magical.
No. No, not that world.
I meant this one.
The smartphone.
Each system and program and app
is its own little planet of perfect technology,
all providing services so necessary,
so crucial, so unbelievably profound.
Look who just sent me a text.
Addie McAllister?
Must be a mistake. Or a joke. Or a scam.
Don't send her your Social Security number.
Dude.
She's right there.
That's our user, Alex.
And, like every freshman in high school,
his whole life, everything, revolves around his phone.
And, as the pace of life gets faster and faster...
Phones down in five.
And attention spans get shorter and shorter and...
You're probably not even listening to me right now.
Who has the time to type out actual words?
And that's where we come in,
the most important invention in the history of communication...
Emojis.
That's my home.
Textopolis.
Here, each of us does one thing,
and we have to nail it every time.
The Christmas Tree just has to
stand there all festive.
Merry Christmas.
It's still September, Tim.
The Princesses...
I am so pretty.
They just got to wear their crowns and keep their hair combed.
You guys, we are so pretty.
Devil, Poop, Thumbs Up.
They just show up, and they're good to go.
But for the faces, the pressure is on.
Crier always has to cry, even if he's just won the lottery.
Hooray! I'm a billionaire!
The Laugher is always laughing,
even if he's just broken his arm.
I can see the bone!
Now, me, I'm a Meh.
So I got to be totally over it all the time,
you know, like, "Meh, who cares?"
Which is not as easy as it sounds.
Morning, Mrs. D. I see you have the little minis with you.
They're so cute.
That is so adorable, I can't take it!
Now I'll never get them to sleep.
Stick to your one face, weirdo.
No! No!
It's hard to always act blase,
when living in Textopolis is just so exciting.
Hello, good simians.
Those are some sharp attaches.
